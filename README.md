#No.Dot

These are my dotfiles. There are many repos just like this one, but this one is mine.

## install

Just run:
```sh
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlackNovaTech/No.Dot/master/install.sh`"
```

It will clone the repo and symlink the relevant files.
If an existing file is found, it will suffix that file with .old
